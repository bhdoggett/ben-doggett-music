{comment: Verse}
Soul, be stirred, he is the Lord
He is Emmanuel
Soul, arise to sing and priase
He lifted you from hell
And forget not all his benefits
Who redeems your life from the pit
Who crowns you with compassion
And loves you all day
And forget not all his benefits
And call back to remembrance
That the Lord your God is faithful
Abounding in grace

{comment: Chorus}
I command my soul to sing
I command my soul to priase
And in light of all I've seen
I will always love your name
