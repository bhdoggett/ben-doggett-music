{comment: Verse 1}
Whom have I in heaven beside you?
And the earth has nothing I desire
But it is good just to be near you
It is good to come and die

{comment: Verse 2}
When I have nothing left to boast in
'Cause I've got nothing to my name
Then I'll have something to rejoice in
And you, you can have all my praise

{comment: Chorus}
'Cause I am broken and poor, but such is the kingdom, Lord
You are our only treasure
And I will set my eyes high on the humble Jesus Christ
His riches know no measure

{comment: Verse 3}
You are my portion and my refuge
though my heart and flesh grow faint
Where have I to run but to you?
You are the one thing that remains

His riches know no measure
His riches know no measure
