{comment: Verse 1}
In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with and was God
In the beginning was the Word
And all things were made by and through him

{comment: Verse 2}
In the beginning was the Light
And the Light was life to all me
In the beginning was the Light
The darkness has not overcome him

{comment: Chorus}
He has made his home here
Heaven robed in flesh and bone
And we have seen his glory
The glory of the only Son of God

Jesus Christ, Light of life
Ancient of days, begotten not made
Jesus Christ, Light of life
Ancient of days, begotten not made
Jesus Christ, Light of life
Ancient of days, begotten not made
Jesus Christ, Light of life
Ancient of days, begotten not made

{comment: Chorus}
He has made his home here
Heaven robed in flesh and bone
And we have seen his glory
The glory of the One and only
He has made his home here
Heaven robed in flesh and bone
And we have seen his glory
The glory of the only Son of God
