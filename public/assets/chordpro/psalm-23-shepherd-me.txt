{comment: Verse 1}
The LORD is My Shepherd, I shall not want
In pastures of green I will rest
Beside quiet waters my soul is restored
I drink and my heart is content
He leads me in righteousness

{comment: Verse 2}
Yea, though I walk through the dark of death
Evil I will not fear
Your rod and your staff are my confidence
My God, you are always near

{comment: Verse 3}
A table you set in the midst of my foes
A banquet prepared just for me
My head drips with oil and my cup overflows
I sit at your table and feast
My shepherd supplies all I need

{comment: Chorus}
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
And I will dwell in the house of God
Through the gates of eternity shepherd me
And I will dwell in your house, O God
