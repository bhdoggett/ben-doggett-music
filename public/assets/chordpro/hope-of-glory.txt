{comment: Verse 1}
I can't see more than a foot in front of my face
I can't stand but for the hope of your mercy
Can't run 'cause the devil's gettin' in my way
O for feet fitted with the gospel of your peace

{comment: Chorus}
I will press on to take hold
Of that for which you have won my soul
I'm not lookin' back behind me
I've got my eyes fixed on my hope of glory

{comment: Verse 2}
I can't feel more than a heartbeat of love
I can't speak much louder than this weak whisper
And how many times have I said I've had enough
O for the day I am gonna see my Savior
