{comment: Verse 1}
I am full of anxiety so come and search me
You are the giver of a peace that surpasses understanding
I have been suffocating in this dark and lonely sea
You would come and comfort if I would only ask you to speak to me

{comment: Chorus}
Come and Speak to me
Come and Speak to me
Come and Speak to me
Come and Speak to me

{comment: Verse 2}
I would come in prayer and petition the God who saves
You have always been ready to hear what I've got to say
I will come with thanks in my heart for the One who bled
You are the very thing I need, I need a Word made flesh
