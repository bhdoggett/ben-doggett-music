{comment: Verse 1}
O my soul, don't forget the way he led you out
O my soul, don't forget
O my soul, come repent of sins that ail you now
O my soul, praise him yet

{comment: Chorus}
And as you find yourself here in a peaceful land
Fail not to remember what he did to bring you in my soul
O my soul, O my soul, O my soul

{comment: Verse 2}
O my soul, don't forget the long and weary night
O my soul, don't forget
O my soul, don't forget the day he saved your life
O my soul, praise him yet

{comment: Verse 3}
O my Lord, you remain a Father and a friend
O my Lord, you remain
O my Lord, God, you save the dead and dying man
O my Lord, God you save, you save

{comment: Chorus}
And as I find myself here in a peaceful land
Always I'll remember what you did to bring me in my Lord
O my Lord, O my Lord, O my Lord
