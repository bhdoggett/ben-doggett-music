{comment: Verse 1}
Whatever was to my profit, I now consider loss
And everything self-righteous, I nail it to the cross
To know you in your death, O Lord, and rise with you again
To know you in your suffering and then my life begins

{comment: Chorus}
Every other lover cannot compare
And anything this world offers will perish and pale
In the light of your glory
In the glow of your beauty

{comment: Verse 2}
Only one thing remains now, to know you all the more
There's only one place to be found, abiding in the Lord
I throw off every hindrance, I'm giving you my eyes
I run the race before me 'cause Jesus is the prize
