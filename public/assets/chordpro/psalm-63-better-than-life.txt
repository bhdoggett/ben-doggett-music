{comment: Verse 1}
O God, you are my God
How earnestly I seek you
How desperately I need you
My heart and flesh cry out

{comment: Verse 2}
O God, you are my God
My soul is dry and weary
My hope is in your mercy
Oh how I need you now

{comment: Chorus}
I have seen you in the sanctuary
I have felt you like a cloud of glory fall
Let my soul remember
Bread of heaven for the hungry spirit
Holy presence of an unrelenting love
Let my soul remember

{comment: Bridge}
Let my soul remember
Your love is better
Let my soul remember
Your love is better than life
