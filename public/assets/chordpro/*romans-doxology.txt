{comment: Verse 1}
Oh the depth of the riches of the knowledge and wisdom
How unsearchable the judgments of the Lord
Who has given him counsel? All his ways are untraceable
Who has known the eternal mind of the Lord

{comment: Chorus}
From you, Lord, and through you, Lord
And to you, Lord are all things
You are the first and you are the last
And yours is all the glory

{comment: Verse 2}
What on earth could we give him, that the Lord should repay it
All our rightful obedience is the Lord's

{comment: Tag}
Yours is the glory forever and ever
And ever and ever, Amen
