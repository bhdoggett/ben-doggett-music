{comment: Verse 1}
Out of the depths I call to you, listen to my plea
Out of the depths I cry the name of Jesus
Battered by my circumstance, broken at your feet
But voice enough to sigh the name of Jesus

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
Where else would I go?
You're my only hope

{comment: Chorus}
More than watchmen wait for morning
I will wait for you my God
In your promise I will glory
All my hope is in your love

{comment: Verse 2}
If you kept a record of, all our sinful ways
Who, O Lord, could stand to face your glory
But full of mercy, rich in love, you have come to save
So in my weary bones I whisper "worthy, you are worthy"

{comment: Bridge}
My soul waits for the break of day
You will surely come, as the rising sun
My soul longs for the coming dawn
You will surely come to us
