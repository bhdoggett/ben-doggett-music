{comment: Verse 1}
In the midst of all my trouble, You are Father
In the midst of every trial, You are Abba
You are Abba, You are Abba

{comment: Verse 2}
Even in my darkest hour, You are Father
Even though I trip and falter, You are Abba
You are Abba, You are Abba

{comment: Chorus}
Not my will but let yours be done
Let your will be my own
Though the pain and the darkness come
I am never alone

{comment: Bridge}
You are Abba Father
You are Abba Father
You are Abba Father
You are Abba Father
