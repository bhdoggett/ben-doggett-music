{comment: Verse 1}
Why are you downcast, O my soul?
Why so disturbed within me?
Set foot on this rock, put your hope in God
he is a sure foundation

{comment: Verse 2}
Why are you downcast, O my soul?
Why so disturbed within me?
Set your weary eyes on the Lord of life
He is our one salvation

{comment: Chorus}
My soul will boast in the Lord
Let the afflicted hear and rejoice
My soul will boast in the Lord
Let the afflicted hear and rejoice

{comment: Verse 3}
Why are you downcast, O my soul?
Why so disturbed within me?
He is arisen now, pouring mercy out
And You have been forgiven
And you have been forgiven
And you have been forgiven

Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna to the King
Behold, O Daughter of Zion
Your Savior riding in
