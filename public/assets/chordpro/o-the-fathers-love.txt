{comment: Verse 1}
You kissed my face when I was your foe
Father you called me home
I had returned to beg at your feet
Here you embraced me

{comment: Chorus}
O the Father's love is overwhelming
Covering all my shame
See the Father run, his arms embrace me
Lifting me up in his grace

{comment: Verse 2}
Riches unheard of, squandered in sin
I spent my inheritance
Now at the cost of your innocent Son
You made a way for us
You made a way for us

{comment: Bridge}
Heaven and earth, when have you heard
When have you seen such a thing?
Wonder of wonders, the heart of the Father
You welcome the prodigal in
