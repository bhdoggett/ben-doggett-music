{comment: Verse 1}
The LORD is my light and my salvation
The LORD is the strength of my life
When evil men assail me, they will stumble and fall
Though the host of hell surround me, I will not fear

{comment: Chorus}
One thing have I asked of the Lord
And this I seek, to see the beauty of my King
One thing does my heart long to know
That you will hide me in the shelter of your wings

{comment: Verse 2}
Hear me, O LORD, when I cry out
Show your great grace and answer me
Hide not your love and mercy, turn me not away
And when the host of hell surround me, my heart will say

{comment: Bridge}
My heart says of you, "Seek his face"
LORD, your face I seek
My heart says of you, "Seek his face"
LORD, your face I seek
My heart says of you, "Seek his face"
LORD, your face I seek
My heart says of you, "Seek his face"
