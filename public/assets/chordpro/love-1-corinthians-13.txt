{comment: Verse 1}
Love is patient, love is kind
Love lets what I cling to and what I want to die
Love is full of hope, love will never boast
Love in purity and all good things delights

{comment: Chorus}
So love the Lord, Your God
With all your strength and mind and heart
Love your neighbor as yourself
And love your enemy as well

{comment: Verse 2}
Love is humble, love is strong
Love can bear all things and love will suffer long
Love will never fade though the earth give way
Love will hold you in his everlasting arms

{comment: Bridge}
If I speak with the tongues of angels (but have not love)
If I give all I own away (but have not love)
Even if I could move the mountains
I am nothing but a resounding noise
